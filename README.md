# Music Genre Classification - PCA
### Predicted Music Category using Principal Component Analysis


Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in data analysis and machine learning. Its primary goal is to reduce the complexity of high-dimensional data while preserving most of its important information.

PCA works by transforming the original features of the data into a new set of orthogonal (uncorrelated) features called principal components. These principal components are ordered in such a way that the first component captures the maximum variance in the data, followed by the second component, and so on. By retaining only the top few principal components that explain the majority of the variance in the data, PCA allows for simplification and visualization of complex datasets.
